# N.B.:  user.* could be set in GIT_AUTHOR_NAME and GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL and those
# should probably be set in ~/.localprofile, though Git is stupid and prefers
# the environment variables over the local settings in the ${REPO}/.git/config
# file.  If global settings are not appropriate then this is the best
# alternative as this is a fallback since the repo config has higher precedence.
# On the other hand if you want to use my (this) ~/.gitconfig then these values
# can be overridden with the environment variables!
#
# This could be in an include file, but it's not secret!
