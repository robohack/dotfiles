# XXX this is the pre-2.0 default, but it apparently can cause some problems
# when working with a shared central repository, e.g. when others push to the
# same "shared" branch.  The new default is "simple", but I don't think I ever
# had a problem with "matching" at Klervi; and "matching" should work better
# when pulling from a forked upstream repo and pushing to the fork (which should

# The theory is if you're following a project and keeping local changes, or
# making changes to be submitted upstream, then you want remote tracking
# branches to fast-forward only on pull, but to be rebased on your local branch
# when you pull from, e.g., "master".  (And, i.e., you never want to commit to
# your local (tracking) "master" branch!  Always make a "local" branch that
# tracks the local remote-tracking "master" branch.)

# latter overrides the former when pulling.

# to have the upstream "master" checked out when doing git-up, git-up won't
# fast-forward the currently checked out branch (since v1.0.6 I think, and up to
# v2.0.2 at least).  Too bad git-up doesn't yet have an override for
# fast-fowarding the current branch (maybe IFF it is a remote-tracking branch
# and it's tracking the ''upstream'' (i.e. "origin")).  Possibly it should
# honour pull.ff=only and branch.BR.mergeOptions=--ff-only; but probably it
# should just use "git pull", which already honours all these flags and options
