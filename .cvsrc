#
# N.B.:  DANGER WARNING!!!
#
# Because I use a read-only local repository a lot (NetBSD) I don't want cvs to
# create locks in $TMPDIR.  However this could cause major problems for writable
# repositories IFF there are multiple users.  Luckily NetBSD's CVS supports a
# global '-u' option that says "Don't create locks".
#
# XXX Ideally I would want per-repository global flags since remote repositories
# may not even allow the global "-u" option (e.g. OpenBSD's).  However there is
# currently no way to specify per-repository options of any sort.
#
# To run against a remote server that doesn't support the global '-u' option,
# e.g. OpenBSD's, comment out the "cvs" line, then do the following in emacs:
#
#	(setq cvs-cvs-flags nil)
#	(cvs-flags-define cvs-cvs-flags '(("-f")))
#	(cvs-reread-cvsrc)
#
# N.B.:  Then don't forget to uncomment the "cvs" line again!!!  (C-x v u)
