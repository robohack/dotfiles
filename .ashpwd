# NOTE: the only real difference between this and .kshpwd is that this
# version only defines a function which hides the builtin (no alias)
# and it then uses the alternate builtin of "chdir".  The content of
# the inner "case" statement should be identical.

	# the directory returned by getcwd(3), and not the symlink(s)

	# desired effect, based on the configuration of the local
